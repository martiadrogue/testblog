# The subject should provide a meaningful commit message, which:
# - The first line of the commit message should be a short description (50
#   characters is the soft limit), and should skip the full stop.
# - Uses the imperative, present tense: “change” not “changed” or “changes”.
#   includes motivation for the change, and contrasts its implementation with
#   previous behaviour.

# The body should provide a meaningful commit message, which:
# - Wrapping your commit messages to 72 columns is a good thing.

# Add, Mod(ify), Rem(ove), Ref(actoring), Fix, Doc(umentation) and Rea(dability)

# Ref: Extract empathy stuff to an abstract class.
# Fix: RUL-42 or #42 Starvation need to be initialised before Energy to avoid the nullpointer in People.
